# Contribute

To contribute to this project you have to:

- Fork this repository
- Create a directory with the name of the instrument
- Create a sampled.json file with metadata information
- Create a subdirectory called samples with the audio files
- Run `npm run build`
- Make a pull request

## sampled.json

The information is stored in a file called `sampled.json`. With this information, the build process create some other `sampled.*.json` files with additional information. The most important is the `sampled.instrument.json` which contains a list of all audio files.

The sampled.json file __must__ contain:

- __description__: A text description
- __source__: an url to the source
- __licenes__: the license name

The configuration file __may__ contain:

- __name__: The collection name (or the directory name if no one provided)
- __pack__: if true, it creates a file called `samples.json` with all the samples packed as base64 audio data (to fetch all the samples in one request)


## Drum machines sample naming conventions

The samples audio files should be named: `inst-variation.ext` where `inst` is the instrument name and `variation` is optional. For example: `snare.wav`, `hihat-open.wav` and `hihat-closed.wav` are valid names. Variations can be nested: `hihat-open-h.wav`

#### Using letters to create variations

The letters `m`, `l` and `h` means mid, lower and higher. `snare-l.wav` it should be a lower snare than `snare-m.wav` and `snare-ll.wav` should be even lower.

#### Using numbers to create variations

You can use numbers padding by 2. `snare-01.wav` is valid, but `snare-1.wav` is not. Anyway, more descriptive variations are preferred: `guiro-long.wav` and `guiro-short.wav` vs. `guiro-01.wav` and `guiro-02.wav`

#### Recommended instrument names

Try to name the sample with one of this names, if possible:

- __snare__
- __rim__ (rimshot, sidesticks)
- __hihat__ (variations: `hihat-open`, `hihat-closed`)
- __kick__
- __tom__
- __crash__
- __cymball__
- __clap__
- __bongo__
- __conga__
- __tamb__ (tambourine)
- __block__
- __cowbell__
- __timbal__
- __cabasa__
- __guiro__
- __clave__
